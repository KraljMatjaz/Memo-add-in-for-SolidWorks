This add-in was created with the help of SolidDNA created by angelsix (https://github.com/angelsix/solidworks-api) but then upgraded and enhanced by CAD-Booster(https://github.com/CAD-Booster/solidworks-api)

Setup guide:
- download "memo install.msi" and "setup.exe" and run "setup.exe" file.
- Chose the installation folder. DO NOT install in PROGRAM FILES, because the program needs to write the directory you chose to save notes to a config file. This will be fixed in upcoming versions. 
- Open SolidWorks -> Tools -> add-ins and enable "Memo add in for SolidWorks" option.
- Memo add in will popup on the right next to appearances and PDM. Chose the folder where the program searches and saves notes. 
- Have fun using it.
